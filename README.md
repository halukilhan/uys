### - autoplay: make videos pause at start or stop not load until you click. 
### - disable annotations. 
### - hide video controls 
### - buffer entire video (disabe dash playback) 
### - and so on.
### 
### - one great option for autoplay setting is "autopause on background". if you open it on same tab it will autoplay. 
### if you open video on background tab it will autopause video. and here is the greatness when you click that video you opened background it will play automaticly. (last step may not work for firefox) so you can open lots of videos background. while you are watching first one, others will load and buffer to end in hd. when you close first one, second one will autoplay...

### Known Bugs: 
### in Html5 player progress bar button sometimes goes ahead red bar. 
### in Flash player playlist videos may stop after first video. 
### in Firefox hiding scrollbars not working 
### 
### Note: every tiny change that Youtube makes can brake script complately. plaase be patient for update.
